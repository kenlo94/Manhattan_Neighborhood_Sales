        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="25" data-line-end="26">The dataset comprises a total of 4,722
            properties, and Harlem-Central ranks first with 1,228 properties, while Midtown East ranks tenth with 125
            properties. One possible reason for the big variance could be the difference in the size and population of
            the two neighborhoods. Harlem-Central is a larger neighborhood with a higher population density than Midtown
            East, which may result in a greater demand for housing and more properties available for sale.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="26" data-line-end="27">The dataset encompasses a total of 135 sales.
            Harlem-Central secures the first position with 31 properties sold, while Washington Heights Lower secures
            the tenth position with four properties sold. It is possible that the difference is due to the disparity in
            the number of properties listed for sale in each neighborhood. There may simply be more opportunities for
            buyers in Harlem-Central. Additionally, factors such as demand, location, and property size also play a
            role.</li>
        <li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="27" data-line-end="28">The largest segment of the properties in the
            dataset is comprised of 2-Family Homes, accounting for 39.8% of the dataset. 1-Family Homes are the second
            most common property type, constituting 37.6% of the dataset, while 3-Family Homes represent the smallest
            share, accounting for 22.5% of the dataset. One factor that might be affecting this is the historic patterns
            of development in Manhattan, which often involved the conversion of single-family homes into multi-family
            dwellings to accommodate the growing population. 2-family homes can provide a good balance between
            affordability and space for families, making them a popular choice in densely populated urban areas like
            Manhattan.</li>

            corner of the report provides users with the ability to select a neighborhood of interest. Upon selection,
            the table below will dynamically update to display pertinent information relating to the sales that occurred
            in the chosen neighborhood.</li>
